# completedProjects
folder with a little documentation of what each project does to show my progression through the years

First project was a python project focused on using TKinter and databases, I completed this back in 2020 and used it during my 24/7 rowing world record to store who was rowing, for how long and for how far. This data was used to validate the world record, as the lack of sleep during this challenge made logging data maually near impossible with our bad handwriting.

Second project was a python project focused on web scraping with the aim of learing more breadth in python coding and understanding HTML and its structures better. I completed this in 2021 where I scraped the name, author, price, ISBN, stock and publisher of 410,000 books, however with this there was a hardware limitation causing it to crash, leading me to add code which "picked up where it left off" in the webscraping process.

Third project was a ANPR system for a units gate, with this my aim was exploring python on raspberry pi and its uses in object and character recognition along with learing more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. This was completed for my A level project in 2022 and would open the gate for number plates present on the database, staying closed for number plates that were not recognised. The raspberry pi also hosted a local web server where I could add number plates, view entries and open the gate through this website.
